Purpose: Sports events are  a source of building skills  in non-technical fields.
Sports events will also help in making our body fit and healthy. The earlier methods for
 registering in these events were cumbersome because we had to move to the place where
 registration was  done. So there was a need to develop a website which will make the process
 of registration easier and quicker than the earlier methods.

So we decided to develop a website where everyone can easily register in events quickly and
 easily. The event organizer will use ‘EVENTOPEDIA’ to organize the event. The participation
 can register in the event by providing a validation certificate and after the event has ended,
 certificate will be delivered to the participants through their email addresses.

The advantage of using ‘EVENTOPEDIA’ is that:
•	Quick and easy registration.
•	Certificate will be easily delivered to the participants.
•	Organizers can notify participants of future events.

Conclusion:The system is developed using HTML,CSS And PHP.The database used is MYSQL and
 the server used is APACHE TOMCAT.
